			<p>My me is a platform to create a personal mnemonic for blood sugar data. By personalizing the visualization one engages with the data in a creative and expressive way. A bespoke and emotional engagement with blood sugar data is a critical aspect of making data ‘actionable’.</p>	
			<p>Medical data is oddly impersonal considering its personal origins. How can people engage with, internalize and process medical data (or any data…) if it does not relate to them in a personalized way? How can the data be actionable or meaningful if we engage with it in binary contexts of numbers that are good or bad and devices that turn on and off.</p>

		<p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>

			<p> Vital Device : a machine or tool that one is dependent on to live. Vital Devices was a series of probes to use during interviews. They were used to explore form, care and relationships people have with the devices they depend on.

			From the research three outstanding insights came through.</p> 
			<ul>
				<li>There is a physical and behavioral impact of the aesthetics of the device (see Harry Harlow)</li>
				<li>The person who is dependent is secure (security also means ability to explore and learn) when it knows that the device will not break.
				“I fear the nurses making changes I don’t control. I hate the tests where they can noticeably change the heart-rate, wired to a machine like a marionette puppet. I wish I could control or have a more intimate relationship with my machine. Instead I sometimes feel out of control and release myself to the fact that I hope the machine knows best.” Interviewie</li>
				<li>There is a cultural obsession with autonomy where inter-dependence and dependence are undesirable. (see Abler)“The pump doesn’t feel like me, its accepted that it is me, but that’s the thing, if I get sick of diabetes I get sick of me.” Interviewie</li>

			<p>Non-Number: Painting as a tool to create images that represent individual experiences of blood sugar numbers
				Insights :
				<ul>
				<li>Numbers are not stagnant, they are one aspect of a whole experience.</li>
				<li>Numbers mean nothing without context. A 200 for 40 minutes is very different than a 200 for 5 hours. A 60 and going up is very different than a 60 going down.</li>
				<li>Creative expression is a powerful way to understand experience and feel ownership of experience.</li>
