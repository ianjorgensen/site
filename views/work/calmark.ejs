			<p>Calmark is more than an app, its the beginning of a revolution. A lab in your pocket. We got approached by Calmark AB, to build an app that would measure and quantify the colourimetric reaction in their disposable in vitro diagnostic blood separation card, Hilda Neo. Applying blood to the card will create a colour reaction in the assay which is measured by the phones camera and translated to values of certain biomarkers. The work we did for them included conceptualising, design and development of the app, the colour balancing, and built standard colour curves for their chemical assays.</p>
			<p>That's all we can share with you at the moment, stay tuned for updates or head over to <a href='http://www.calmark.se'>Calmark.se</a> for more information.</p>
